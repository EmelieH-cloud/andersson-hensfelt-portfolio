Our story begins with being students in the same school to become software developers. 
One day, one of us happened to be walking right outside the other’s apartment complex. <br></br><br></br>
It was only moments later that we discovered we were actually neighbors all along. This discovery
 led to countless days spent coding together, lounging in sweatpants, and navigating various
  techincal challenges throughout the summer.<br></br><br></br>
As we spent more time together, a shared passion for programming grew, and we realized
 we had a common dream: to create apps based on ideas we love. And so, our journey began—a journey filled with creativity, collaboration, and plenty of laughter. What started as a friendly neighborly encounter evolved into a company dedicated to turning our ideas into reality with creative solutions.
